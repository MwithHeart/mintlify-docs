## Get started in four steps

Hello there, developer! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Dribble API documentation, where ideas turn into interactive apps. 

### Step 1: Register an app

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a developer account">
      Create an account on the [Dribble home page](https://dribbble.com/account/applications/new) or sign in
    
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Register your app">
    1. In the new dashboard, click the side menu and select **Applications**.
    3. In the Developers section, select **Register a New Application**
    4. Fill the form on the page with your app details and the callback URL.
    5. Click **Create Your Application**
    
    <Tip>
    The callback URL is the URL to which Dribbble will redirect users after they authorize your app.
    For example:  
    - Website URL: https://myportfolio.com

    - Callback URL: https://myportfolio.com/auth/dribbble/callback
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Get an access token

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Get your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`">
    When you click **Create Your Application**, your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` show at the bottom of the page.
    
    <Tip> These are valuable details that you should keep safe for later </Tip>
    
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Get authorization">
    1. Sign in to your dribble account
    2. In a new window, go to the following url:  ```https://dribbble.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID``` 
      <Note> Replace *CLIENT_ID* with the Client ID you got after registering your app. </Note>
    3. An authorization page shows with your registered app name.
    4. Select **Authorize**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


### Step 3: Get the token
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get your code">
    1. After authorizing, you will be redirected to a URL with this format: `http://callback_url?code=`
      <Note> The http://callback_url will be the callback URL you entered when you registered your app. </Note>
    2. Copy the string that comes after *?code=* till the the end of the URL. 
    3. That is the `Code`. Paste it in a secure place as you will need it. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Get the token using Postman">
    1. On Postman, create a new request.
    2. Change the HTTP Method to **POST**. 
    3. Paste the URL *https://dribbble.com/oauth/token*
    4. In the **Params** tab, add the keys:  
        - client_id,
        - client_secret
        - code  
        - redirect_uri (optional)
    5. Add their values in the fields in front of them
    6. Click **Send**
    7. Your token shows up as a JSON response.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 4: Get a user's details
