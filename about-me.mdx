### 👋 Hi, I’m Mariam Yusuff
I’m a **technical Writer** passionate about **APIs, DevOps, and Cloud documentation**.  
I simplify complex systems into clear, usable, and beautiful documentation that helps developers work faster and smarter.

<Card title="What I Do" icon="pen-to-square">
  - Write **API docs** that reduce onboarding time and confusion.  
  - Lint documentation for consistency using **CI/CD pipelines**.  
  - Organize **developer docs** using  **Docs-as-Code** approach.  
</Card>

<Card title="What I Use" icon="palette">
  `Docusaurus` · `Mintlify` · `OpenAPI` · `Postman` ·   `Swagger`
  `GitHub Actions` · `Vale` · `Spectral` · `Markdown`  
  `CI/CD` · `GitHub` · `VS Code`  
</Card>

Docs are quiet engineers. They solve problems before support tickets do.

### 🌿 Beyond Docs

When I’m not writing, I’m usually:
- capturing nature through my lens 📸  
- learning about sustainability and clean energy 🌿  
- watching animes or Youtube reels on pastries ✨
