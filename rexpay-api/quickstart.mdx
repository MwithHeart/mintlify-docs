## Get Started In Two Steps

Hello there, developer! 👋

Welcome to the RexPay API documentation, where businesses accept payments seamlessly across web, mobile, and POS channels.  

### Step 1: Create an account
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Register your app">
    1. Sign up for a [RexPay account](https://www.myrexpay.ng/signup) or login.
    2. Complete your profile details. 
    3. From the menu, select **Developer Tools**
    4. The page shows your **Secret Key** and **Base URL**. 

      <Note> 
        Store your key securely as an environment variable. Do not share it or commit it to GitHub.
      </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Make your first API call
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title= "Use the 'Get Transaction Status' endpoint to check payment details.">
    1. Paste the following code into your command line:

      ```bash
      curl -X POST https://pgs-sandbox.globalaccelerex.com/api/pgs/payment/v2/createPayment \
        -u "your_email@example.com:your_secret_key" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
          "reference": "INV-10001",
          "userId": "ga",
          "amount": 10000,
          "currency": "NGN",
          "customer": {
            "email": "customer@example.com",
            "name": "Jane Doe"
          }
        }'
      ```

    2. You should get a response similar to the following:

        ```json
        {
          "status": "success",
          "message": "Payment initialized successfully",
          "data": {
            "paymentUrl": "https://pay.rexpay.com/checkout/xyz123",
            "reference": "INV-10001"
          }
        }
        ```
        The payment status was returned as **Success** which means the payemnt went thrugh.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
