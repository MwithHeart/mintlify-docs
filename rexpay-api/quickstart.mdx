## Get Started In Two Steps

Hello there, developer! 👋

Welcome to the RexPay API documentation, where businesses accept payments seamlessly across web, mobile, and POS channels.  

### Step 1: Create an account
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Register your app">
    1. Sign up for a [RexPay account](https://www.myrexpay.ng/signup) or login.
    2. Complete your profile details. 
    3. From the menu, select **Developer Tools**
    4. The page shows your **Secret Key** and **Base URL**. 

      <Note> 
        Store your key securely as an environment variable. Do not share it or commit it to GitHub.
      </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Make your first API call
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title= "Use an endpoint to check payment details">
    Use the **Get Transaction Status** endpoint to check payment details.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://pgs-sandbox.globalaccelerex.com/api/pgs/payment/v2/createPayment \
      -u "your_email@example.com:your_secret_key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "reference": "INV-10001",
        "userId": "ga",
        "amount": 10000,
        "currency": "NGN",
        "customer": {
          "email": "customer@example.com",
          "name": "Jane Doe"
        }
      }'
    ```

    **Expected Response:**

      ```json
      {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Payment initialized successfully",
        "data": {
          "paymentUrl": "https://pay.rexpay.com/checkout/xyz123",
          "reference": "INV-10001"
        }
      }
      ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
