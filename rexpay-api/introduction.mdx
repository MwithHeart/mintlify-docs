description: 'RexPay API Documentation (Rewritten for Clarity and Developer Flow)'
---

### Overview
A reverse-engineered documentation project where I analyzed and rewrote the ... sections of the [RexPay API documentation](https://payvantage.gitbook.io/payvantage.gitbook.io), focusing on improving clarity, developer onboarding, and content structure using Docusaurus.

### Objective
The goal was to evaluate how effectively Payvantage's original API documentation helped developers start quickly, and to **redesign it with clearer steps, better structure, and modern documentation practices** (e.g. using examples, logical grouping, and progressive onboarding).

### My Role
* Technical Writer (solo project)
* Responsible for research, information architecture, markdown authoring, and front-end doc presentation.


### **Tools & Stack**
* **Markdown + MDX** - for content formatting
* **Mintlify** - for documentation and deployment
* **Git + VS Code** - version control and workflow


### **Process**
1. **Analyzed the Original Docs**

   * Noted unclear navigation
   * Observed unclear information across pages

2. **Rewrote for Clarity**
   * Created a **Quickstart** page guiding new developers faster.
   * Broke authentication down into **simple steps** with sample requests/responses.
   
3. **Improved Structure**

   * Used consistent headings and spacing (following Stripe’s and OpenAI’s structure).

4. **Published + Iterated**

   * Deployed on Mintlify.
   * Shared online for feedback from fellow technical writers and developers.

### Before vs After (Key Improvements)
| Feature             | Original Docs     | Rewritten Version                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quickstart flow** | Not available     | Single-page linear guide                          |
| **Code examples**   | Limited           | Multi-language with inline responses              |
| **Tone**            | Formal & vague    | Action-oriented, developer-friendly               |
| **Navigation**      | Sparse links      | Linked structure (Auth → First Call → Next Steps) |

### Outcome
✅ Developers can now authenticate and make their first successful API call in a few minutes.

  * [Authentication Page](./authentication)

### Reflection
This project helped me understand:
* How to structure docs for *progressive onboarding*.
* The importance of clear, action-driven instructions in API docs.
* How developer empathy drives documentation design.
