description: 'RexPay API Documentation (Rewritten for Clarity and Developer Flow)'
---

A reverse-engineered documentation project where I analyzed and rewrote some sections of the [RexPay API documentation](https://payvantage.gitbook.io/payvantage.gitbook.io), focusing on improving clarity, developer onboarding, and content structure.

<Note>
*The pages here are still under construction.*  
</Note>

### Objective
The goal was to evaluate how effectively RexPay's original API documentation helped developers start quickly, and to **redesign it with clearer steps, better structure, and modern documentation practices** (e.g. using examples, logical grouping, error handling, and progressive onboarding).

### My Role
* Technical Writer (solo project)
* Responsible for research, information architecture, markdown authoring, and front-end doc presentation.


### **Tools & Stack**
* **Markdown + MDX** - for content formatting
* **Mintlify** - for documentation and deployment
* **Git + VS Code** - version control and workflow


### **Process**
1. **Analyzed the Original Docs**

   * Noted unclear navigation
   * Observed confusing information across pages
 
2. **Improved Structure**
   * The actual Quickstartpage is reference-heavy and not task-oriented. 
   * Created a **Quickstart** page guiding new developers faster.
   * Used consistent headings and spacing (following Stripe’s and OpenAI’s structure).

3.  **Polished The API Reference Pages**
   * The API Reference pages are not interactive. 
   * Most of the reference pages do not touch on errors.
   * The HTTP verb is not specified.
   * Endpoints not properly arranged.
   * Code samples are provided in Javascript only.
   
4. **Published + Iterated**

   * Deployed on Mintlify.
   * Shared online for feedback from fellow technical writers and developers.



### Before vs After (Key Improvements)
| Feature             | Original Docs     | Rewritten Version                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quickstart flow** | Reference-heavy   | Task-oriented to guide new developers             |
| **Code examples**   | Limited           | Multi-language with interactive display to test the code         |
| **Tone**            | Formal & vague    | Action-oriented, developer-friendly               |
| **Navigation**      | Sparse links      | Linked structure (Auth → First Call → Next Steps) |
| **Error Handling Page** | Not available | Provided a page dedicated to possible errors that developers may face |


### Outcome
✅ Developers can now authenticate and make their first successful API call in a few minutes.
