description: A growing collection of API documentation projects by Mariam

Welcome to my **API Documentation Hub**, a curated space where I rewrite, analyze, and create **developer-focused documentation** using real-world APIs.

This hub highlights my work as a **Technical Writer specializing in API documentation**, with an emphasis on clarity, structure, and developer experience.



## What you’ll find here

Each project showcases how I approach technical writing through the lens of developer empathy and documentation design.

- **✍️ Clarity-First Writing:** Turning complex API concepts into actionable, easy-to-follow guides.  
- **⚙️ Information Architecture:** Structuring docs for smooth navigation and logical flow.  
- **🧩 Tool Proficiency:** Using Mintlify, Postman, Git, and cURL to test and document APIs.  
- **🚀 Developer Experience:** Writing docs that explain not just *what* an API does — but *how to use it effectively*.  


## Featured Projects

## About This Space

This hub complements my [main portfolio](https://writetech-accelerator-portfolio-mar.vercel.app/), where I document my broader technical writing journey.  
Here, I focus purely on **API documentation projects** to demonstrate how I merge **technical accuracy**, **information architecture**, and **clear writing** to make developer learning faster and more intuitive.
