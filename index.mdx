Welcome to my **API Documentation Hub**, a curated space where I rewrite, analyze, and create **developer-focused documentation** using real-world APIs.

This hub highlights my work as a **Technical Writer specializing in API documentation**, with an emphasis on clarity, structure, and developer experience.

## About This Space

This hub complements my [main portfolio](https://writetech-accelerator-portfolio-mar.vercel.app/), where I document my broader technical writing journey.  
Here, I focus purely on **API documentation projects** to demonstrate how I merge **technical accuracy**, **information architecture**, and **clear writing** to make developer learning faster and more intuitive.
