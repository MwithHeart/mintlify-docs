## Get started in three steps

Hello there, developer! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Dribble API documentation, where ideas turn into interactive apps. 

### Step 1: Register an app

1. Create a developer account





<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a [Dribble account](https://dribbble.com/account/applications/new) or login.">
      Click the [link](https://dribbble.com/account/applications/new)
    
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Register an application">
    1. In the side menu, select **Applications**
    2. In the Developers section, select **Register a New Application**
    3. Fill the form on the page with your app details and add the callback URL yourself
    
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install our GitHub app">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="palette" title="Update your site name and colors">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Publish your docs">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get your code">
    1. After authorizing, you will be redirected to a URL with this format: `http://callback_url?code=`
      <Note> The http://callback_url will be the callback URL you entered when you registered your app. </Note>
    2. Copy the string that comes after *?code=* till the the end of the URL. 
    3. That is the `Code`. Paste it in a secure place as you will need it. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Get the token using Postman">
    1. On Postman, create a new request.
    2. Change the HTTP Method to **POST**. 
    3. Paste the URL *https://dribbble.com/oauth/token*
    4. In the **Params** tab, add the keys:  
        - client_id,
        - client_secret
        - code  
        - redirect_uri (optional)
    5. Add their values in the fields in front of them
    6. Click **Send**
    7. Your token shows up as a JSON response.
