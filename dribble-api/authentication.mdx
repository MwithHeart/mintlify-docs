The Dribbble API uses *OAuth 2.0* to securely authenticate applications.
This guide walks you through how to register your app, authorize users, and obtain your access token.


## Overview

OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol for secure delegated access.  
Instead of sharing passwords, users grant your app permission to act on their behalf using **tokens**.

Here’s how the Dribbble OAuth flow works:

1. Register your app to get a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.  
2. Direct users to the *authorization URL*.
3. Receive a *code* when they approve your app.  
4. Exchange that code for an *access token*.  
5. Use the token to make authenticated requests.  


#### Step 1: Register your application
    1. Create an account on the Dribble home page or login.
    2. Visit the [Applications page](https://dribbble.com/account/applications/new).  
    3. Select Applications from the side menu
    2. Click **Register a New Application**.  
    3. Enter your app details and **callback URL**.  
    4. Click **Create Your Application**.  
    5. Your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** show up at the bottom of the page. Copy them and keep them safe.

    <Tip>
    Your callback URL is the endpoint where Dribbble redirects users after they approve access.  
    Example: `https://myportfolio.com/auth/dribbble/callback`
    </Tip>
    
#### Step 2: Request user authorization
    1. Redirect users to the following URL:

        ```
        https://dribbble.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
        ```


    2. Once the user approves, Dribbble redirects them to your callback URL with a `code`:

        ``` 
        https://your-callback-url?code=9892aebf...
        ```

#### Step 3: Exchange the code for an access token

    Use your **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and **Authorization Code** to request a token.

        ```bash
        curl -X POST "https://dribbble.com/oauth/token" \
            -d client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
            -d client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
            -d code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE \
            -d redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL
        ````

    You’ll receive a JSON response like:

        ```json
        {
        "access_token": "abc123...",
        "token_type": "bearer"
        }
        ```

    <Note>
    Store your access token securely. Do not expose it publicly (for example, in frontend code or GitHub repos).
    </Note>

#### Step 4: Use the access token  - Fix the code here

    Include your token in the query parameter:

        ```
        Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
        ```

    Example:

        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
        https://api.dribbble.com/v2/user
        ```

    Response:

        ```json
        {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "username": "janedesigns"
        }
        ```

### Handle Common Errors

| Error             | Description                   | How to fix                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `invalid_client`  | Incorrect Client ID or Secret | Double check the client_id and client_secret to make sure they are correct | 
| `invalid_grant`   | Code expired or reused        | Request a new authorization code   |
| `unauthorized`    | Token missing or invalid      | Include the `Authorization` header |
| `400 Bad Request` | Missing required parameter    | Verify your query parameters       |
| `Redirect URI Mismatch` | Redirect URI doesn't match the previous one | Provide a redirect_uri that matches what you registered or leave out this parameter to use the default one registered with your application |

### Token Management Tips
- **Tokens typically don’t expire quickly**, but can be revoked anytime via your Dribbble account.
- Always **use HTTPS** to keep tokens secure in transit.
