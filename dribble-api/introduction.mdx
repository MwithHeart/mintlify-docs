description: 'Dribbble API Documentation ‚Äî Authentication & Quickstart (Rewritten for Clarity and Developer Flow)'
---


### Overview

A reverse-engineered documentation project where I analyzed and rewrote the **Authentication** and **Quickstart** sections of the [Dribbble API](https://developer.dribbble.com), focusing on improving clarity, developer onboarding, and content structure using Docusaurus.


### Objective

The goal was to evaluate how effectively Dribbble‚Äôs original API documentation helped developers start quickly, and to **redesign it with clearer steps, better structure, and modern documentation practices** (e.g. using examples, logical grouping, and progressive onboarding).



### My Role

* Technical Writer (solo project)
* Responsible for research, information architecture, markdown authoring, and front-end doc presentation.


### **Tools & Stack**

* **Docusaurus** - static site generator
* **Markdown + MDX** - for content formatting
* **Mintlify** - for deployment
* **Git + VS Code** - version control and workflow


### **Process**

1. **Analyzed the Original Docs**

   * Noted unclear navigation
   * Observed inconsistent tone between pages

2. **Rewrote for Clarity**
   * Created a **Quickstart** page guiding new developers in less than 5 minutes.
   * Broke authentication down into **simple steps** with sample requests/responses.
   * Added a ‚ÄúBefore You Begin‚Äù section to improve flow.

3. **Improved Structure**

   * Added breadcrumbs and internal links for better navigation.
   * Used consistent headings and spacing (following Stripe‚Äôs and OpenAI‚Äôs structure).

4. **Published + Iterated**

   * Deployed on Vercel.
   * Shared online for feedback from fellow technical writers and developers.

### **Before vs After (Key Improvements)**

| Feature             | Original Docs     | Rewritten Version                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quickstart flow** | 6 steps scattered | Single-page linear guide                          |
| **Code examples**   | Limited           | Multi-language with inline responses              |
| **Tone**            | Formal & vague    | Action-oriented, developer-friendly               |
| **Navigation**      | Sparse links      | Linked structure (Auth ‚Üí First Call ‚Üí Next Steps) |

---

### **Outcome**

‚úÖ Developers can now authenticate and make their first successful API call in **under 5 minutes**.

### **Reflection**

This project helped me understand:

* How to structure docs for *progressive onboarding*.
* The importance of clear, action-driven instructions in API docs.
* How developer empathy drives documentation design.

Next, I plan to apply similar techniques to a **FinTech API (like Interswitch or Flutterwave)** to deepen my understanding of authentication flows and webhook integrations.
