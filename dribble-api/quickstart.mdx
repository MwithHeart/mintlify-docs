Welcome, developer! ðŸ‘‹  
The Dribbble API lets you turn creative design data into interactive experiences; from fetching shots to building design galleries or analytics dashboards.

In this guide, youâ€™ll make your first authenticated API request in just a few minutes.

---
### 1. Create a developer account

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Register your app">
    1. Create an account on the [Dribbble page](https://dribbble.com/session/new). Or sign in.  
    2. Go to `https://dribbble.com/account/applications`.
    3. On the side menu, click **Applications** and select **Register a New Application**.  
    3. Fill in your app details including your **callback URL**.  
    4. Click **Create Your Application**.  

    <Tip>
      The callback URL is where Dribbble redirects users after they authorize your app.  
      Example: 
      - Website URL: `https://myportfolio.com`
      - Callback URL: `https://myportfolio.com/auth/dribbble/callback`
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

When you create your app, the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** show up at the bottom of the page, keep these safe.



## 2. Get your access token

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Youâ€™ll need an access token to make API requests">
    Check the [Authentication guide](./authentication) for a step-by-step guide.
    Once you get your credentials, use the following cURL request to get an access token:

      ```bash
      curl -X POST "https://dribbble.com/oauth/token" \
        -d client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
        -d client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
        -d code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE \
        -d redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL
      ````

    Expected response:

      ```json
      {
        "access_token": "abc123...",
        "token_type": "bearer"
      }
      ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  Save your `access_token`. Youâ€™ll use it in all subsequent API calls.

## 3. Make your first request

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Letâ€™s fetch the authenticated userâ€™s Dribbble profile">
      ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      https://api.dribbble.com/v2/user
    ```

  If successful, you should get a `200 OK` response like this:

    ```json
    {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "username": "janedesigns"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
âœ… **Congratulations!**
You just made your first successful API call using the Dribbble API.
